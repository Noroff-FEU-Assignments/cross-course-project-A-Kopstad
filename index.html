    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
        Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> I would advise a potential client to secure their website from web security attacks by firstly using https instead of http, 
        as http is'nt encrypted, whereas https is, and can protect the data which is transferred between server and client, from malicious attacks. 
        What I also would advice my client, is to use third-party applications and solutions for authentication, and sanitazion of data. 
        It is also important to remember to consume an API that has taken implementation of automatic user timeout into consideration, in order to prevent users personal information from being taken advantage of.
        Lastly, I would recommend to use CI/CD to protect from unauthorized changes. </p>
